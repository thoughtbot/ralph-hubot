# Ralph

This is Ralph, a Campfire bot.  He's based on GitHub's Campfire bot framework, hubot. He hangs out in the "Everyone" and "Ralphy Boy" rooms. Use "Ralphy Boy" for testing so you don't annoy people.

## Setup

Install the dependencies:

    npm install -g hubot coffee-script
    # In the ralph-hubot directory:
    npm install

Set up Heroku:

    git remote add heroku git@heroku.com:ralph-hubot.git


### Testing Hubot Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following.

    # The --alias lets you do '/pug' instead of 'hubot pug'
    bin/hubot --alias /
    Hubot>

You'll see some start up output about where your scripts come from and a
prompt.

    [Sun, 04 Dec 2011 18:41:11 GMT] INFO Loading adapter shell
    [Sun, 04 Dec 2011 18:41:11 GMT] INFO Loading scripts from /home/tomb/Development/hubot/scripts
    [Sun, 04 Dec 2011 18:41:11 GMT] INFO Loading scripts from /home/tomb/Development/hubot/src/scripts
    Hubot>

Then you can interact with hubot by typing `hubot help`.

    Hubot> hubot help

    Hubot> animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds a few
    convert me <expression> to <units> - Convert expression to given units.
    help - Displays all of the help commands that Hubot knows about.
    ...


### Scripting

Take a look at the scripts in the `./scripts` folder for examples.
Delete any scripts you think are useless or boring.  Add whatever functionality you
want hubot to have. Read up on what you can do with hubot in the [Scripting Guide](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md).

## hubot-scripts

There will inevitably be functionality that everyone will want. Instead
of adding it to hubot itself, you can submit pull requests to
[hubot-scripts][hubot-scripts].

To enable scripts from the hubot-scripts package, add the script name with
extension as a double quoted string to the `hubot-scripts.json` file in this
repo.

## external-scripts

Tired of waiting for your script to be merged into `hubot-scripts`? Want to
maintain the repository and package yourself? Then this added functionality
maybe for you!

Hubot is now able to load scripts from third-party `npm` packages! To enable
this functionality you can follow the following steps.

1. Add the packages as dependencies into your `package.json`
2. `npm install` to make sure those packages are installed

To enable third-party scripts that you've added you will need to add the package
name as a double quoted string to the `external-scripts.json` file in this repo.

## Restart the bot

You may want to get comfortable with `heroku logs` and `heroku restart`
if you're having issues.
